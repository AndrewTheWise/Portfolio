<h2 style="font-family:'Arial', serif;color:white;"><u>MY SKILLS</u></h2>
<p class="skills" style="font-family:'Arial', serif;color:white;">Throughout my life, I have faced many challenges. My senior year in highschool, I was told by my teachers and principal that there was no way I was going to<br>graduate due to me getting behind on work after being absent for three weeks during covid along with my teachers not assigning any online work. My teachers<br>were so sure there was no way I was going to be able to get caught on my class work... Yet I managed to pass my classes, graduate early, and make it onto the<br>honor roll... I don't let anything get in my way. My biggest skill is definitly my dedication for getting things done.<br><br><b>My Technical Skills:</b><br>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, DJango, and more to come...<br>I am a partially self-taught programmer. I've been working with<br>these softwares in school and on my own to create things like<br>webpages, games, ect. You can view some of my work by<br>clicking <a href="https://andrew-wise-portfolio.andrew-wise.repl.co/projectsofmine.html">here</a>.</p>
